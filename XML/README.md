# XML Merge

Using xml.etree.ElementTree and dicttoxml to merge 2 XML files containing user-data scuh as first name, last name and email, ensuring no duplicate users in the final file (target.xml).

## Improvements

- [ ] Users who did not enter their first name and last name should be excluded from target.xml
- [ ] Consider "a.nonymous@mailinator.com" and "anon.ymous@mailinator.com" as duplicate emails.
- [ ] Add additional elements
