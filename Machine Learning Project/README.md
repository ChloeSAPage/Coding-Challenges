# Machine Learning Project

Trying to find the best model to use in order to predict which cohort, 1 or 0, a player belongs to based on multiple features. The best models were Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours and Decision Tree.

## Things to improve

- [ ] Better Data Preperation - removing outliers
- [ ] Pick a better method to balance the cohort ammount the model is trained on, to ensure no bias.
